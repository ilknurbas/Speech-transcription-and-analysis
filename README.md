# Speech-transcription-and-analysis

This repository includes materials for a task focused on manual speech transcription, acoustic analysis, and synthesis. The tasks involve **segmenting speech into words and phones, measuring segment durations, analyzing formant frequencies and fundamental frequency (F0), and performing concatenative synthesis using Praat and MATLAB**. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with speech transcription, basic acoustic measurements, and signal processing techniques. The dataset used is a speech sample from the LibriSpeech corpus. *Note that some sections of the codes are based on templates provided.*
